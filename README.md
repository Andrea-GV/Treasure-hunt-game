## Description

This project was created for fun and to improve my programming skills. The Treasure Hunt game is built with React, using JavaScript, and styled with CSS.

## Functionality

The game is simple and entertaining:

- The user who wants to play enters the number of rows and columns for the board through prompts.
- The user clicks on the board to discover and find the treasure.
- Keep in mind, that it will count your attempts until you reach the gold.
- When the game ends, the user has the opportunity to play again by clicking the "Reset Game" button.
